It's a library that adds new functions related to text and talking, like jokes, questions, quotes, facts and advices.
To add it to your project use Jitpack. Add this to your built.gradle:
```built.gradle
repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
dependencies {
    implementation "com.github.OVNSAME:Companion:main"
}
```
Online API's were used for the library. You can see all the functions in the Companion class, it's easy to use because there are just static functions that return String.
